# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classical ML algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- Combines multiple datasets of real and fake news
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / etc.)
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- High performance (~94% accuracy)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled fake and real news articles.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TF-IDF (text vectorization)

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: 94%
- F1-score: 0.94
- Balanced classification performance

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Try deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Add Streamlit/Flask web app
- Expand to multilingual news articles

## 📎 How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `FakeNewsDetection.ipynb` on Jupyter or Colab
3. Train your model
4. Test predictions
